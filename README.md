# Q-learning
Q learning is  a basic method to implement Any Reinforcement Learning Model.

# Project Description 
Task is to train A RL agent for a Manufacturing warehouse that can perform one of 9 motion given a particular state of location . Total state possible =9 and total action=9
Reward table is made such that it perform motion in shortest possible time .
To train model Bellman Equation used .
Input to Model : Current Location , Desired Location
Output to Model : Shortest path Traversal between Current and Desired Location
